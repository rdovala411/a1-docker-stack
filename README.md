This project is **Assignment 1** for Cloud Computing for Data Analysis.  
It builds a **two-container stack** using Docker Compose:

- **Service 1: PostgreSQL**  
  Runs a seeded database with a `trips` table (city, minutes, fare).  
- **Service 2: Python app**  
  Connects to PostgreSQL, runs queries, computes simple stats, prints summary to stdout, and saves `/out/summary.json`.

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have installed:
- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose
- Git (optional, for version control)

### One-command run

From the project root:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build the images  
- Start PostgreSQL  
- Wait until DB is healthy  
- Run the Python app  
- Print a JSON summary  
- Save results to `out/summary.json`

### Using the Makefile (optional)

```bash
make up     # build + start
make down   # stop + remove containers/volumes
make clean  # full reset (clears out/ folder)
```

    }
  ]
}
```


## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **DB not ready / app stuck at “Waiting for database…”**  
  Run:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  docker compose up --build
  ```

- **Port 5432 already in use**  
  Stop local Postgres or change the DB port in `compose.yml`.

- **No summary.json created**  
  Ensure `out/` exists and is mounted in `compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./out:/out
  ```

- **Makefile not working**  
  Ensure you used **tabs** (not spaces) before each command.



## ✍️ Reflection

Working on this project taught me how to spin up multiple containers with Docker Compose and have them talk to each other, which was a first for me. I really liked seeing how the database could be automatically seeded with data using an init script — it made the setup feel smooth and repeatable. I also ran into some of the classic issues like waiting for the database to be ready and figuring out volume mounts, which gave me a better feel for debugging container setups. If I were to improve this, I’d probably add more data, write some tests for the Python app, and try to slim down the Docker images a bit.
